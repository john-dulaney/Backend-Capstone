Welcome to **Triplann**, your one stop shop for planning a packing list for your upcoming trip. In Order to use this Application, you will need to install several depencies. Assuming you have a grasp of terminal and have a package manager, I will let you interpret this to your system, as I know everyne isn't on a mac. The first step is cloning the Repo.

1. Navigate to the directory where you wish to install my app and type:
```
git clone origin git@github.com:john-dulaney/Triplann.git
```
2. after it downloads type  `npm i`

1. Now you have the dependencies. You need the DB access now. go to my API's repo and follow the steps to install.

1. The API I query was made by me and can be found here:
**[Tripplan-API](https://github.com/john-dulaney/Triplann-API)**

.
.
.

5. Now that the api is listening, we can start the client app, navigate to the client directory using that new terminal window you opened. once there run the following command while in the project folder:
```
npm start
```

6. that command will open up the client side application automatically in your default browser. Enjoy!
